this is a new sort of experimentation i'm trying to achieve, as i'm bored as hell right now.
# i'm making changes here now

1. [[home]] is a boilerplate for the repo i forked it from (idk how to connect that with vercel, maybe someday)
2. [[README]] - self explanatory
3. [[Contents - Maths]] - all maths notes
4. [[Contents - JS]] - all JS notes
5. [[Contents - C]] - all C notes
